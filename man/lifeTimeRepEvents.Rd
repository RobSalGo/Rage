\title{Calculates the timing of lifetime reproductive events.}
\usage{
lifeTimeRepEvents(matU, matF, matC = FALSE, startLife = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{A matrix containing only survival-dependent processes (e.g. progression,
stasis, retrogression).}

\item{matF}{A matrix containing only sexual reproduction, with zeros
elsewhere.}

\item{matC}{A matrix containing only clonal reproduction, with zeros
elsewhere. If not provided, it defaults to a matrix with all zeros.}

\item{startLife}{The first stage at which the author considers the beginning
of life in the life cycle of the species. It defaults to the first stage.}
}
\value{
This function applies Markov chain approaches to decompose various
moments of reproduction along the age-based trajectory of individuals in a matrix
population model. When both a 'matF' and a 'matC' are provided, the
following outputs are calculated for both independently, and these are
differentiated with the suffix "Fec" or "Clo", respectively:

- 'p': probability of achiving maturity, sexual or clonal.

- 'La': mean age at maturity (in the same units as the matrix population
model sampling periodicity).

- 'meanLifeExpectancy': mean life expectancy conditional on entering the
life cycle at the value of 'startLife'.

- 'remainingMatureLifeExpectancy': Life expectancy from mean maturity. This
is calculated as mean life expectancy - mean age at maturity ('La' above). This value can
be negative because both mean life expectancy and mean age at maturity are
means of their respective distributions, and their distributions can indeed overlap.

\description{
A function to calculate the timing of lifetime reproductive events such as
the probability of achieving maturity, age at first reproduction, mean life
expectancy conditional on maturity, and life expectancy for mature
individuals.
